MOBILE CONTROLS INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS
==============================================

The new SDK-compliant mobile controls have been created in:
  assets/ui/mobile-controls.html

OPTION 1 - Manual Integration (Recommended):
--------------------------------------------
1. Open assets/ui/index.html in an editor
2. Find the line with: </body> or </html> near the end
3. BEFORE that closing tag, copy and paste the entire contents of mobile-controls.html
4. Save the file

OPTION 2 - Use the provided mobile-controls.html separately:
------------------------------------------------------------
This file can be loaded as an additional UI layer, but it's better to integrate it into index.html

KEY CHANGES MADE:
-----------------
1. ✅ Disabled custom mobile input handlers in UIEventHandlers.ts (lines 138-156)
2. ✅ Simplified handleMobileModeEnabled to not process mobile inputs
3. ✅ Created SDK-compliant mobile controls that use hytopia.pressInput()
4. ✅ Mobile buttons only show when body.mobile class is present (set by Hytopia)
5. ✅ Removed custom virtual joystick (Hytopia provides this automatically)
6. ✅ Removed custom camera handlers (Hytopia provides this automatically)

WHAT HYTOPIA SDK HANDLES AUTOMATICALLY:
----------------------------------------
- Movement joystick (left 40% of screen)
- Camera rotation (right 60% of screen)
- Mobile device detection (adds .mobile class to body)
- Input streaming from client to server

WHAT WE PROVIDE:
----------------
- Action buttons (Shoot, Pass, Sprint, Tackle)
- Simple hytopia.pressInput() calls for actions
- Touch-optimized button sizes and positioning

TESTING:
--------
1. Run: npm run build
2. Run: npm start
3. Test on mobile device or use browser dev tools mobile emulation
4. Enable mobile view (F12 -> Device toolbar icon)
5. Set to landscape mode
6. Refresh page
7. Verify .mobile class is added to <body>
8. Verify action buttons appear and respond to touch
